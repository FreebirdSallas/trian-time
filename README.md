## Tools Used
* HTML
* CSS
* FireBase
* Moment.js
* Javascript

## Process

For this project I have created an application that incorporates\
firesbase to host arrival and departure data. This app should\
retrieve and manipulate the information with Moment.js. This website\
will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely\
their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
